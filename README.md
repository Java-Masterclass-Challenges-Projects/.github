Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This organization contains my coursework projects, personal experiments, and practice challenges built while working through the **Java Masterclass 2025** on Udemy.

ðŸ”§ **Focus Areas**:
- Java Fundamentals & OOP
- Backend Systems & REST APIs

- Real-world applications and plugin development (Minecraft, APIs, etc.)

ðŸ’¡ Projects are built using IntelliJ, Maven, and Git, and follow object-oriented design principles.
